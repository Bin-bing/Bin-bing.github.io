  <h1>Artist statement</h1>
  <p>I'm a soprano singer. It was not some composer or singer who inspired me to learn music; it was my mother. With her unconditional support, I started learning to sing. I always remember that there was one vocal teacher in China said that, "You have to relax your neck when you sing. If you don’t, the audience won’t hear clearly what you are singing. And also you cannot let the audience think that the bel canto is meant to be hard to understand." This made me realize for the singer theory, skill, and language are important.</p>    
  <p>Since then,I have always been looking for ways to make my singing more imaginative. I have come to understand that singing is the only thing that can make me feel happy, and it is only through singing that I am able to express myself fully, so this is how I want it to be: I want the audience to see the same imagery I have in my mind, to feel the same emotions that wash over me, solely by listening to how I sing. I want them to be as immersed in the song as I am, to weep or to smile with me.</p>
